8.Now five mapper and reducer to their respective functions using the code along with assigning the path to output and input file
 


	hadoop jar /usr/lib/hadoop-mapreduce/hadoop-streaming.jar  -file /home/cloudera/matrixmultiply/mapper.py -mapper 'python mapper.py' -file /home/cloudera/matrixmultiply/reducer.py -reducer 'python 		reducer.py' -input /matrix/input.txt -output /matrix/outputmatrix
